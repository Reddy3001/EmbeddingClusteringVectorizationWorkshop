    "**What is Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to transform words into vector representations.\n",
    "It learns these word vectors (embeddings) from a large collection of text so that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who developed it and when?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec was developed by a team of researchers at Google, led by Tomas Mikolov, in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who currently maintains and supports new releases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original research came from Google, the open-source Python library gensim now maintains Word2Vec functionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Each **leaf node** (at the left) is a word from the vocabulary.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What This Means\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dendrogram shows how the words are **grouped step-by-step**.\n",

    "### 🧠 Introduction to GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is GloVe?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)** is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to learn word embeddings from large amounts of text data. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GloVe** is a word embedding model that learns **vector representations of words** by using **global word co-occurrence statistics** from a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Word2Vec (which learns embeddings through local context windows), GloVe builds a **co-occurrence matrix** and then learns word vectors from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who developed it and when?**\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe was developed by researchers at **Stanford University**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jeffrey Pennington**, **Richard Socher**, and **Christopher Manning**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was first introduced in **2014**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Who currently maintains and supports new releases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The official code and pretrained models are available at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove)\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe is not actively developed anymore, but the pretrained models are widely used.\n",
    "Unofficial implementations exist in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Gensim`\n",
    "* `glove-python` (Python wrapper around original C code)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How do I use GloVe in Python and Jupyter Notebooks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📦 Option 1: Create a model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is a model in GloVe?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **GloVe model** is a file that contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A large vocabulary of words\n",
    "* For each word: a **fixed-length vector** (e.g., 50D, 100D, 300D)\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors are learned by factorizing a word-word **co-occurrence matrix** so that **similar words** have **similar vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Create a GloVe Model Using Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "> GloVe training is more complex than Word2Vec and originally written in C. But here’s a basic pipeline using `glove-python-binary`:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Step 1: Install the Library\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install glove-python-binary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Step 2: Create and Train a GloVe Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from glove import Corpus, Glove\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Prepare your corpus\n",
    "sentences = [['this', 'is', 'an', 'example'], ['glove', 'is', 'awesome']]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Build a co-occurrence corpus\n",
    "corpus = Corpus()\n",
    "corpus.fit(sentences, window=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Train the GloVe model\n",
    "glove_model = Glove(no_components=100, learning_rate=0.05)\n",
    "glove_model.fit(corpus.matrix, epochs=20, no_threads=4, verbose=True)\n",
    "glove_model.add_dictionary(corpus.dictionary)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Use the model\n",
